- Ground : Its the variable to trigger if its actually on ground or not.
- vsp : Its the vertical movement variable.

A code originally made by Shaun Spalding on Its tutorial and edited by me, considering
one of the most common and efficient ways of handle platform collisions.

The code is free to use, but need credits to me,
and maybe for Shaun too :D
